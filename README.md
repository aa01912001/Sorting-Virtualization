## sorting algrithoms:
In this app, you can select any sorting strategy from following list to see how they work

- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Cocktail Sort**
- **Gnome Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

We use strategy pattern in the javascript code, so you can easily implement your sorting algrithom and integrate into it.

## Metrics
We provide following three metrics to observe the difference between  different sorting algrithoms.

- **Swap Times**: the total number of times that swapping two elements during sorting
- **Comparison Times**: the total number of times that comparing two elements during sorting
- **Duration**: the time cost to sort all elements
